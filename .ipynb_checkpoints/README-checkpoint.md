# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project about New York City Airbnb listings is to identify patterns, trends, potential insights about the listings characteristics. The objective is to create a dashboard that can help quickly understand the Airbnb landscape through KPIs, maps and visual comparisons.

## Process
### Exploration of the dataset
Reviewed the data and defined questions such as:
How has the number of listings evolved over time ? 
What are the most expensive or affordable neighbourhoods ?
Who are the top hosts ? 
### Preparation and Visualization creation
### Dashboard assembly

## Results
I observed that a few hosts dominate the listings market, with a significantly above average number of listings. 
Certain neighbourhoods are clearly more expansive than others, with prices according the room type.
There is not a strong that strong of a relationship between the Review Rating Scores and the Prices of the listings.
A lot of listings are concentrated in specific areas.
The overall number of listings has increased over the years. 

## Challenges 
Some charts needed further filtering (for example: removing outliers and extreme values), sizing and labelling to remain understandable. 
I needed to choose and balance informations to keep a certain clarity and not overcrowd the dashboard.

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would have added more interactive filters with maybe a number of beds one, or a price range one.
I could also have added an evolution of average price over years with a forecasting.
